# Homer3
Homer3 is a MATLAB application used for analyzing fNIRS data to obtain estimates and maps of brain activation. It is a continuation of the work on the well-established HOMER2 software which itself evolved since the early 1990s, first as the Photon Migration Imaging Toolbox, then HOMER and HOMER2.

Homer3 is developed and maintained by the [Boston University Neurophotonics Center](http://www.bu.edu/neurophotonics/).

# Note (2021/12/15)
This is rewritten from Homer3_development branch (v1.31.2), modified by Louis Tai-Jai Chang (張太睿) and used for broadband functional near-infrared spectroscopy analysis in my master thesis: "Evaluation and Comparison of the Hemodynamic Response Function of the Prefrontal Cortex by Broadband Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging." (Biomedical Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging Lab, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, NTU)

Our lab (BOSI Lab) has made our own CW-fNIRS system, and actually, we can measure and analyze over 5 different wavelengths at the same time.
And with Monte Carlo Method, we can get optical parameters (mainly for mean pathlengths).
By using AltasViewer/Freesurfer/SPM12, you can place your own probe design on the real brain model of your subjects.
If you have any questions about using this version of Homer3, please contact me via: louis120913@gmail.com
